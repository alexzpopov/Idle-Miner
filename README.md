This is a simulation game with the raw UI. Primary purpose of this project was to implement an expandable code architecture. 

##### Highlights:

  - MVC
  - Dependency Injection
  - Reactive Programing
  - Promises
  - State Machine
  - Generic Popup System
  - Spine2D (Pending)

| Plugins | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|[Unity3D] | [3D Game Engine.][GE]|
| [Zenject] | [Dependency Injection.][DE] |
| [UniRx] | [Reactive Programming.][RP] |
| [C# Promises] | [Asynchronous coding.][AC] |
| [Spine] | [2D Animation.][SP] |

#### Installation
  - Pull the code.
  - Use Unity 2018.2.0f2 to open it.
  - Check /MainMenu/Potato-Games/Always Start from Startup Scene.
  - Press Play.

#### Information:
Delete the /Assets/StreamingAssets/GameState.json if you want to run the default gamestate again.
Meta is not balanced. So you will have to manage.

### Todos
 - Add spine animations.
