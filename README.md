# Idle Miner

This is a simulation game with the raw UI. Primary purpose of this project was to implement an expandable code architecture. 

##### Highlights:
  - Unity 2019.4.0f1
  - MVC
  - Dependency Injection
  - Reactive Programing
  - Promises
  - State Machine
  - Generic Popup System
  - Spine2D (Pending)

| Plugins | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
|[Unity3D] | [3D Game Engine.][GE]|
| [Zenject] | [Dependency Injection.][DE] |
| [UniRx] | [Reactive Programming.][RP] |
| [C# Promises] | [Asynchronous coding.][AC] |
| [Spine] | [2D Animation.][SP] |

#### Installation
  - Pull the code.
  - Use Unity 2019.4.0f1 to open it.
  - Check /MainMenu/Potato-Games/Always Start from Startup Scene.
  - Press Play.

#### Hierarchy Overview:
  - All the Context code is in __\Assets\Scripts\IdleMiner\Contexts__. Each scene has the respective folders including some extra scenes like Popup and Hud etc.
  - __GamePlay__ scene has all the __magic__.
  - __Bootstrap__ is the starting scene.
  - __*Data__ files\classes are for __Metadata__ objects.
  - __*RemoteData__ files/classes are for __GameState__ objects and I am linking the *Data on loading of GameState.
  - __*RemoteDataModel__ are the Models that contain __RemoteData__ and other reactive properties and collections.
  - __\Assets\Scripts\Core__ is __submodule__ that contains just the abstract of some generics that can be shared across the project so I have added it to minimise my work.
  - All the __Scenes__ are in __Scenes__ folder and __respective resources__ are in __\Assets\Resources\Scenes__
  - Main __Game code__ is in __\Assets\Scripts\IdleMiner__.
  - (__Models__, __RemoteData__ and __Data__)__s__ are in __\Assets\Scripts\IdleMiner\Models__.
  - All the __Commands__ are in   __\Assets\Scripts\IdleMiner\Commands__.

#### Information:
Delete the /Assets/StreamingAssets/GameState.json if you want to run the default gamestate again.
Meta is not balanced. So you will have to manage.


### Development
Want to contribute? Great!
Create PR if you want to change something.


### Todos
 - Add spine animations.
 - Add Managers and Upgrade functionality.
 - Balance and refactor the Meta.
 - Make it reactive to the member wise. Currently it is refreshing the whole Model on update.
 - Write Tests.
